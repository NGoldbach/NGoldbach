Hi there :) 

I'm a 26 year old student who's working towards his bachelor in CS.
As part of wanting to improve my skillset, i try to work on projects that i develop an interest in during my spare time.
I will upload essentially all my projects here. 

The repository i'll maintain on Github is mainly for myself, or for access amongst close friends/project groupmembers.
However, i have nothing against other people looking through this stuff if they're interested and/or want to 
share some ways to improve what i'm working on. I'd be happy to hear how i can improve algorithms, code-structure,
etc., especially as i would still consider myself a beginner in pretty much all areas. 

Thank you in advance for taking an interest in any of my silly projects, be it to help or just out of curiosity. See you around!
